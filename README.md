# PGA Tours Data Analysis
## Overview
Welcome to the Golf Skill Analysis project! This data analysis project aims to address the age-old question in golf: "Drive for show, putt for dough." We will leverage PGA Tour data to investigate whether training in putting is indeed more critical for overall performance than honing one's driving skills.

## Problem Framing
The central problem we're tackling is identifying the ideal golf skill to train for improving an individual's overall golf score. Specifically, we want to assess whether the conventional wisdom favoring putting over driving holds true in the context of PGA Tour data. This analysis can offer valuable insights into which aspect of the game is more impactful and guide players, both new and experienced, on where to focus their training efforts.

## Data
We will use PGA Tour data, which includes various performance metrics for professional golfers. This dataset provides us with the necessary information to evaluate the importance of driving and putting skills in determining overall performance.

## Assumptions
To conduct this analysis effectively, we make several defensible assumptions:
* Skill Independence: We assume that driving and putting skills are relatively independent of each other. Improving one skill does not hinder the development of the other.
* PGA Tour Data Accuracy: The PGA Tour data we use is accurate and reliable, with minimal outliers that could skew our conclusions.
* Consistency: The data spans a consistent timeframe, free from significant rule changes or course alterations that could disproportionately impact driving or putting performance.
* Skill Improvement: Golfers can improve their skills through training and practice.
* Skill Consistency: Golfers maintain relatively consistent skill levels in driving and putting throughout a given season, with no sudden or dramatic changes.
* Equal Weighting: We assume that driving and putting skills are equally weighted in determining overall golf performance.
* External Factors: External factors such as weather conditions, course conditions, and golfer health are consistent or accounted for in the analysis, so they do not significantly skew the results.

## Candidate Solution
Our analysis will involve a comprehensive examination of PGA Tour data, including correlation analysis, statistical tests, and segmentation by player experience levels. We aim to provide insights into whether putting or driving skills are more critical for overall success on the golf course.

## Implications
The implications of our findings could significantly impact golfers at all skill levels. If our analysis confirms that putting is more critical, both new and experienced players may want to prioritize putting practice. However, if driving proves to be equally or more important, players may need to rethink their training strategies. Additionally, our analysis may reveal undervalued players who could benefit from upskilling in either putting or driving, potentially changing the landscape of professional golf.
